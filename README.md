# Pizza Bot

This was a project done in the Technigo Bootcamp - Spring 2020
It is a pair programming project where we constructed a Pizza Bot.

Programmers:
Tuliany Grande
Ragna √ûorbj√∂rg √ölfarsd√≥ttir

## The problem

The assignment was to make a pizza bot that would take orders and reply with messages. 
This was a difficult assignment but we managed to get through it, although it could be done in a more refined way. 

If we had more time we would make it so that if the user makes a mistake the code would loop neatly into questioning again.
